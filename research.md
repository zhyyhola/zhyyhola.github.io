# Research

My research focuses on **modality** and **degree semantics** in natural language. Specifically, I investigate how linguistic structures express meaning and how language interacts with thought. Below are some highlights from my academic work and conference presentations:

## Selected Presentations

- **2023:** *Language Attitudes Towards the Lianyungang Dialect*, The 8th International Conference on Language Documentation & Conservation (ICLDC 8), Hawaii, US.
- **2023:** *Acoustic correlates of Mongolian Stress are better explained by default-to-same than default-to-opposite: a preliminary investigation*, LSA 97th Annual Meeting, Denver, US.  
  <small>(Co-authored with Ryan Chon, Yin Wang, Joe Garcia, and Kate L. Lindsey)</small>
- **2019:** *The Study on Modal Dei in Lianyungang Dialect*, The 27th Annual Conference of the International Association of Chinese Linguistics (IACL-27), Kobe, Japan.
- **2018:** *The Preverbal and Post-verbal Modal Constructions: A Case in Lianyungang Dialect*, The 8th International Conference on Formal Linguistics (ICFL-8), Hangzhou, China.

## Research Interests

- **Modality:**  
  Investigating how different types of modality (e.g., deontic, epistemic, dynamic) are expressed across dialects, particularly in Central Plains Mandarin and Lianyungang Dialect.
- **Degree Semantics:**  
  Studying degree expressions in Mandarin Chinese, such as adjectives and degree adverbs, and their syntactic and semantic properties.
- **Language Documentation:**  
  Exploring the linguistic attitudes and structures of underrepresented languages, such as Mongolian and regional Chinese dialects.
- **Language and Thought:**  
  Examining the relationship between linguistic structure and cognitive processes, with a focus on how language shapes human thinking.
