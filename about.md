# About Me

<p>
  Hi! My name is <strong>Yuanyuan Zhang</strong>. I was born in eastern China. I grew up speaking Central Plains Mandarin and Standard Mandarin, and I also picked up some Cantonese along the way. Besides English, I later studied Japanese, Spanish, and even some Japanese Sign Language.

  My academic journey also brought me to explore less commonly studied languages. For instance, I conducted research on Mongolian and learned about its fascinating grammatical structures. My passion for linguistics extends to understanding the intricate relationship between language structure and human thought.
