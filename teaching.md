# Teaching

<p>
  I have had the pleasure of teaching <strong>LX250: Introduction to Linguistics</strong>, an engaging course that introduces students to the fundamentals of linguistic theory, including syntax, semantics, phonetics, and morphology.
</p>
<p>
  Beyond linguistics, I have several years of experience teaching Mandarin Chinese to students of various ages and proficiency levels. My teaching experience includes working with both foreign learners and native Chinese speakers, allowing me to adapt my teaching methods to meet diverse language learning needs. I have taught children, teenagers, and adults, and I strive to create a dynamic and supportive learning environment for all my students.
</p>
<p>
  My teaching philosophy emphasizes interaction, clarity, and cultural context, making language learning not only effective but also enjoyable for students.
